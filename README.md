# PRODIGY_DS_05
In this project, I analyzed the US Accidents Dataset to uncover patterns and trends related to road accidents in the U.S. The analysis included data cleaning, handling missing values, and exploring categorical and numerical features. I visualized the top cities and states with the highest and lowest number of accidents, examined the severity distribution, and analyzed accident occurrences by year, time of day, and weather conditions. 
Additionally, I created scatter plots to highlight accident hotspots based on geographic coordinates and used bar plots to showcase accident distribution by various factors. This project provided insights into the impact of time, location, and weather on accident rates.
