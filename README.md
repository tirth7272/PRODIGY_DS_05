# PRODIGY_DS_05
In this project, I performed an analysis of the US Accidents Dataset to identify patterns and trends in road accidents across the United States. The data was cleaned by handling missing values, removing unnecessary columns, and replacing categorical missing values with the mode. I explored accident occurrences across different cities and states, highlighting the top and bottom regions with the most and least accidents. I also examined the severity of accidents, visualizing their distribution using pie charts and bar plots.

Additionally, I analyzed how factors like time of day, year, and weather conditions impact the occurrence of accidents. I categorized time into morning, afternoon, evening, and night, and plotted the distribution of accidents across these time zones. Scatter plots were used to map accident hotspots based on geographic data, showing how accidents are distributed across various locations and severities. The project provided insights into the key factors contributing to accidents, offering a deeper understanding of how location, time, and weather play roles in road safety.
